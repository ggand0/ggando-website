I spent the last week debugging the performance bottlneck of the wgpu integration version of my app. At first, I thought it was rendfering or update but those parts only took 20~30ms, which should have given me at least 30FPS but when I measured FPS it was less than 15.

I burned 500 API calls on Cursor debugging this (lol), but it turns out that **the bottleneck was the event loop itself**. I noticed weird gaps between the end of `window_event()` and the start of next event. It's been bothering me so much how the previous version of my app was way faster on macOS (MBP with M1 chip) using iced's event loop, but the wgpu-integrated version doesn't.

So I ended up hypothesizing that iced's event loop ([iced_winit::program](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/blob/0.13.1/winit/src/program.rs)) must be faster than winit's default one. I tested this theory by generating a new event loop with Claude 3.7, that adapts iced's event loop. It can be roughly summarized like this:
```rust
use std::sync::mpsc::{self, Receiver, Sender};
use winit::{
    event::{Event, WindowEvent},
    event_loop::{ControlFlow, EventLoop, EventLoopProxy},
    window::WindowBuilder,
};

enum Control {
    ChangeFlow(ControlFlow),
    Exit,
}

fn main() {
    let event_loop = EventLoop::with_user_event();
    let proxy: EventLoopProxy<()> = event_loop.create_proxy();
    
    // Create communication channels for event handling
    let (event_sender, event_receiver): (Sender<Event<'_, ()>>, Receiver<Event<'_, ()>>) = mpsc::channel();
    let (control_sender, control_receiver): (Sender<Control>, Receiver<Control>) = mpsc::channel();

    let window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .build(&event_loop)
        .expect("Failed to create window");

    event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
        *control_flow = ControlFlow::Poll;

        // Send events to the queue instead of handling them immediately
        if let Err(_) = event_sender.send(event.to_static().unwrap()) {
            return; // Exit if sender is dropped
        }

        // Process control messages asynchronously
        while let Ok(control) = control_receiver.try_recv() {
            match control {
                Control::ChangeFlow(flow) => *control_flow = flow,
                Control::Exit => *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit,
            }
        }

        // Handle events from queue (non-blocking)
        while let Ok(event) = event_receiver.try_recv() {
            match event {
                Event::WindowEvent { event, .. } => match event {
                    WindowEvent::CloseRequested => {
                        control_sender.send(Control::Exit).ok();
                    }
                    WindowEvent::Resized(size) => {
                        println!("Window resized to: {:?}", size);
                    }
                    _ => {}
                },
                Event::RedrawRequested(_) => {
                    println!("Redraw triggered");
                }
                _ => {}
            }
        }

        // Request a redraw when needed (avoids redundant frames)
        window.request_redraw();
    });
}

```
I haven't fully understood it yet, but the key difference seems to be how this loop handles events asynchronously, while the winit's loop handles them synchronously. You can observe this in this part:
```rust
let (event_sender, event_receiver): (Sender<Event<'_, ()>>, Receiver<Event<'_, ()>>) = mpsc::channel();
let (control_sender, control_receiver): (Sender<Control>, Receiver<Control>) = mpsc::channel();
```
Here's a quote from GPT:
> This implementation queues events in a channel (mpsc::channel()), allowing them to be handled separately from the main event loop execution. The event_sender pushes incoming events into a queue, while event_receiver.try_recv() pulls them for processing without blocking the loop. 

While debugging this, I also noticed that sometimes winit produces a flood of CursorMoved events, and every time this happens, the app seemed to process them one by one, also triggering re-render for each event. I think this setup keeps the app responsive by throwing those spammy events to an async channe instead of blocking the loop. If you're making a wgpu + winit app you might be able to speed up your app this way too. Here's [the link to the full event loop](https://github.com/ggand0/viewskater/blob/atlas/src/main.rs) I used in my main.rs.
