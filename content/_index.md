I'm a freelance machine learning engineer focused on computer vision. I help my clients build vision AI systems from data labeling, data generation to production model deployment on cloud. I have professional experiences in training deep neural networks for semantic segmentation, object tracking, and action recognition tasks. I'm always up for a new exciting ML/CV project, so shoot me a DM if you're interested to work with me!

Previously, I did my MSCS degree at UMass Amherst and contributed to video recognition ML models at two startups for 3 years. In my free time, I work on independent projects, such as the ones listed here.
