Welcome to my blog! This is a placeholder post for debugging.

July 1, 1966 was a historical date when the MIT Summer Vision Project was proposed by Seymour Papert. This project marked a significant moment in the history of computer science and artificial intelligence. It aimed to explore computer vision by developing algorithms capable of understanding visual scenes.

The idea seemed deceptively simple: get a computer to recognize objects in an image. Little did the researchers know, this "summer project" would evolve into a decades-long challenge, laying the groundwork for modern advancements in computer vision and machine learning.

Today, computer vision powers applications from facial recognition and self-driving cars to medical imaging and augmented reality. The vision of those early pioneers continues to inspire researchers and developers worldwide.

Stay tuned for more updates as I build this blog to explore topics like this and beyond!
