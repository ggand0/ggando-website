name = "SO-101 Pick-and-Lift RL"
desc = "Reinforcement learning training for robot arm manipulation in MuJoCo simulation. Developed a custom Gymnasium environment for the SO-101 arm to learn cube grasping and lifting using SAC with Stable-Baselines3. Achieved 100% success rate on state-based RL after iterating through 11 reward function versions, discovering emergent 'bump and grab' behaviors. Currently exploring pixel-based RL with DrQ-v2, reaching 10% grasp success from camera observations. The SO-101 arm is typically used with imitation learning (LeRobot/ACT), so this explores a pure RL approach instead."

name = "Bevy 3D Dodge - Reinforcement Learning Game"
desc = "A 3D projectile dodging game built with Bevy Engine (Rust) integrated with Gymnasium for reinforcement learning research. The project explores continuous control RL algorithms (PPO and SAC) using Stable-Baselines3 to train agents that learn optimal dodging strategies. SAC achieved 2.4x better performance than PPO with half the training steps, with a 15% success rate of surviving indefinitely (1000+ steps) in challenging scenarios with randomized projectile patterns."

desc = "A fast data viewer for viewing a large number of images, written in Rust. I always had the pain of having to manually plot image samples with matplotlib, or using slow built-in image viewers during explatory data analysis (EDA) for ML projects. This desktop app aims to alleviate this issue by dynamically caching images and providing UI with a responsive slider and a dual-pane view (which I can extend to N panes later)."
