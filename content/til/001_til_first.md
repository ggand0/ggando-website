I usually do tech journaling on my local note taking app, but I realized that sometimes those notes are worth sharing. It feels too technical to publish on platforms like X and the volume tends to be too small for blog posts, so I made a designated section just to dump them. If this doesn't work I'll go back to just making blogs, but we'll see.
